# Data Flow

## Overview

The `advanced-ai-work` project follows a modular data flow pipeline, designed for efficiency, scalability, and seamless integration between components. This document describes the step-by-step flow of data from ingestion to visualization, ensuring clarity in how each module interacts within the system.

## Data Flow Stages

### 1. **Data Ingestion**

- **Frontend (webpage):**
  - Users upload data (e.g., images, text, audio) through forms or APIs.
  - Files are temporarily stored in the `uploads` directory under appropriate categories (audio, documents, images, videos).
- **API:**
  - Receives and validates data using defined routes (`auth.py`, `data.py`).
  - Passes the data to preprocessing utilities (`utils.py`).

---

### 2. **Preprocessing**

- **Directory:** `scripts` and `tools` (e.g., `ml_tools`, `utility_tools`)
- **Actions:**
  - Cleans and formats the data.
  - Extracts features and generates embeddings (stored in `embeddings`).
  - Validates data consistency and readiness for modeling.

---

### 3. **Model Interaction**

- **Directory:** `ml_models`, `rl_agents`
- **Actions:**
  - Data is sent to machine learning or reinforcement learning models for inference or training.
  - Pre-trained models are loaded from `ml_models` (e.g., `image_models`, `text_models`).
  - RL agents utilize configurations from `rl_agents` to train or simulate environments.

---

### 4. **Results and Embeddings**

- **Directory:** `embeddings`
- **Actions:**
  - Embeddings for processed data are generated and stored for future analysis.
  - Results from models (e.g., predictions, decisions) are saved in structured formats.

---

### 5. **Visualization and Explainability**

- **Directory:** `webpage`, `xai_tools`
- **Actions:**
  - Results and metrics are visualized using dashboards in the `webpage` directory.
  - XAI tools like SHAP and LIME provide interpretability for model outputs.

## Summary

The data flow in `advanced-ai-work` ensures modularity, clarity, and scalability. From ingestion through preprocessing and modeling to visualization, each step is designed to work seamlessly with others, facilitating the development of advanced AI solutions.
